[ ] Working with the large flat file was not great on my machine. Using the CSV file method as specified made
my code unworkable and I have dropped it. I don't understand at all why I should be saving the model in a csv.


[ ] GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz must be loaded to the ./data folder

## Notes

- A lot of time was wasted using the CSV file method. I have dropped it in the current implementation as I don't understand the purpose
- Trying to automate the download from google was also a time drain, this definitely should have been dropped
- Phrase file should be passed in for simplicity
